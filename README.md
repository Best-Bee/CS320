How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

By testing code frequently via different methods (testing via JUnit tests and by other more manual methods of testing) you can ensure that your code is much more efficiently made and designed than otherwise.
When it comes to functionality these testing methods (enspecially JUnit tests) are invaluable for ensuring that every piece of the program functions as intended because JUnit tests allow you to quickly
annd efficiently test individual chunks or aspects of your code to make sure everything is working.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Me personally I just try to look at the the words say and do that (sounds silly but it tends to work, and no, I'm not being sarcastic even if it sounds like I am), really I think I just try to not assume
anything or do more than what i was explicitly requested to do.

How do I approach designing software?

For software I (in the past) just kinda brute force trudged through it piece by piece and when it comes to coding stuff i still think i do that a bit more than I should. I really do need to plan more when it
comes to developing stuff but I've not been met with overwhelming resistance in trudging through requirements one after another so I guess I'll do a mix of that and planning depending on how professional I
need to be (obviously for a job I'd be planning and writing out everything in comments beforehand).
